The issue arises from using `even` in `:nth-child(even)`.  To target specific children, you need to use a more appropriate formula.

For example:

* To target every third child: `:nth-child(3n)`
* To target the first and third child: `:nth-child(2n+1)`

Here's a corrected example targeting every third child:

```css
.container div:nth-child(3n) {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

Adjust the formula within the parentheses to match your specific styling requirements.

The following CSS code snippet attempts to style elements based on their position within a container using the `:nth-child` pseudo-class.  However, it only targets even-numbered children.

```css
.container div:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

This might lead to unexpected styling issues if you intend to style specific children (e.g., every third child) or a more complex selection.
